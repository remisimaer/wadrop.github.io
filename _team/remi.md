I have been developing my technical, DevOps, coordination, and support skills for several years within development teams at Capgemini.

I am continuously improving my knowledge of architecture solutions to ensure optimized, high-performance designs while maintaining project budget control.

I particularly appreciate Drupal, but I also enjoy discovering new technologies in the projects I work on.
