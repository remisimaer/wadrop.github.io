## Genesis of the Project

The idea to create WaDrop.org was born from a simple but fundamental observation: despite the existence of a dynamic and rapidly expanding Drupal ecosystem in Japan, there was a critical lack of a centralized platform providing easy access to all available resources for professionals and enthusiasts of this CMS.

It is in this context that Rémi SIMAER, in close collaboration with Takahiro KOMATSU, decided to create this platform with several ambitious goals:

### Create a Comprehensive Repository

Gather in one place all useful information about Drupal in Japan, whether it's specific modules, best practices, or technical resources.

### Facilitate Access to Resources

Offer developers and companies a simple and efficient gateway to discover and use Drupal solutions adapted to the Japanese market.

### Promote the Local Ecosystem

Highlight Japanese actors in the Drupal world, their contributions and innovations, in order to strengthen the visibility of this dynamic community.

### Support Newcomers

Provide practical guides and advice to anyone wishing to learn Drupal or understand the specifics of the Japanese market.

## Who Is This Site For?

WaDrop.org has been designed to meet the needs of various audiences:

- **Developers**: Who are looking for specific modules, technical solutions, or best practices adapted to the Japanese market.

- **Companies**: Who want to understand the Drupal ecosystem in Japan, evaluate its potential, or identify local partners.

- **The Curious**: Who want to discover this technological community, its actors, and its cultural particularities.

## Why Jekyll Rather Than Drupal?

A question many people ask: why doesn't a site about Drupal use Drupal? Here are our reasons:

- **Simplified Hosting**: Thanks to GitHub Pages, we can host our site for free, without having to manage complex servers or worry about security updates.

- **Optimal Performance**: The CDN integrated with GitHub Pages ensures fast loading of our site across all continents, which is essential for reaching an international audience.

- **Lighter Maintenance**: Without the need for a database or dynamic components, we can focus on content quality rather than technical site management.

- **Long-term Sustainability**: This site receives no monetary compensation. For primarily economic reasons and to ensure the site's longevity, we chose a solution that requires minimal resources and maintenance costs.

Although we are passionate about Drupal and actively promote it, we chose Jekyll for this specific project because it was the most suitable solution for our current needs. This decision reflects our professional approach and our commitment to always using the most appropriate technology for each situation.
