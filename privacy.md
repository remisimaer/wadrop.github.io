# Privacy Policy

Last updated: December 11, 2025

## Introduction

WaDrop.org ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you visit our website.

## Information We Collect

### Analytics Data

With your consent, we use Google Analytics to understand how visitors use our website. This includes:

- Pages visited
- Time spent on pages
- Browser type and version
- Device type
- Geographic location (country/city level)
- Referral sources

Google Analytics uses cookies to track this information. These cookies do not collect personally identifiable information unless you explicitly provide it elsewhere on our site.

### IP Anonymization

We have enabled IP anonymization in Google Analytics, which means your full IP address is never stored. Google Analytics anonymizes IP addresses before storing them.

## Cookies

### What Are Cookies?

Cookies are small text files stored on your device when you visit websites. They help websites remember your preferences and improve your experience.

### Our Use of Cookies

We only use cookies for Google Analytics, and only with your explicit consent. You can:

- **Accept cookies**: Google Analytics will track your visit to help us understand how people use our site
- **Decline cookies**: No tracking cookies will be stored, and Google Analytics will not track your visit

Your choice is saved for 365 days. You can change your preference at any time by clicking the button below:

## Third-Party Services

### Google Analytics

We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google LLC. Google Analytics uses cookies to help us analyze how users interact with our website.

Google's use of data is governed by [their privacy policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

You can opt out of Google Analytics by installing the [Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

## Data Retention

Google Analytics data is retained for 26 months, after which it is automatically deleted.

## Your Rights

Under GDPR and other privacy laws, you have the right to:

- **Access** your data
- **Rectify** inaccurate data
- **Erase** your data
- **Restrict** processing of your data

Since we only collect anonymous analytics data through Google Analytics (when you consent), we do not store any personally identifiable information that could be accessed or deleted.
